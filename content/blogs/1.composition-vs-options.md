# Introduction

Vue has always been praised for its simplicity and developer experience. With Vue 3, the **Composition API** was introduced as an alternative to the traditional **Options API**.  

For small projects, both approaches work well. But when you scale into **enterprise-level applications** with dozens of contributors, complex domains, and long-term maintainability concerns, the **Composition API offers clear advantages**.  

In this post, we’ll explore **why** the Composition API is better suited for large teams and real-world production scenarios, with practical examples along the way.

---

## What Is the Composition API?

The Composition API is a set of APIs that allow you to write Vue components using **functions** instead of object options. It focuses on **logical grouping** rather than lifecycle options.

Example (simple counter):

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
const increment = () => count.value++
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="increment">Count: {{ count }}</button>
</template>
```

Instead of placing `data`, `methods`, and `computed` separately, all logic for `count` lives together.

## Why the Composition API Scales Better

### 1. **Logic Grouping vs. Logic Splitting**

- **Options API**: logic is scattered across `data`, `methods`, `computed`.  
- **Composition API**: related logic is grouped in composables.

➡️ For large teams, grouping related logic reduces **context switching** and **cognitive overhead**.

---

### 2. **Code Reuse with Composables**

With the Composition API, you can extract reusable functions called **composables**.

```ts
// useUser.ts
import { ref } from 'vue'

export function useUser() {
  const user = ref(null)
  const setUser = (u: any) => (user.value = u)
  return { user, setUser }
}
```

Now any component can import and use `useUser()`.  
This is far more powerful and maintainable than mixins or duplicated logic in Options API.

---

### 3. **TypeScript Support**

- Options API with TypeScript often feels verbose and unintuitive.  
- Composition API embraces TypeScript naturally with `ref`, `computed`, and generics.  

➡️ This makes **refactoring safer** and reduces bugs in large codebases.

---

### 4. **Testing and Maintainability**

Composables can be tested in isolation:

```ts
import { useUser } from './useUser'

test('sets user correctly', () => {
  const { user, setUser } = useUser()
  setUser({ name: 'Eron' })
  expect(user.value.name).toBe('Eron')
})
```

This modular approach means teams can build and validate features independently.

---

### 5. **Team Collaboration**

In enterprise settings, teams often split responsibilities.  
- With Options API, multiple devs working on the same component = merge conflicts.  
- With Composition API, logic can be extracted into **composables** or **modules**, allowing teams to work in parallel with fewer conflicts.

---

## When to Use Options API

The Options API still shines for:  
- **Small projects** with simple components.  
- **Teams of juniors** who benefit from its simplicity.  
- **Legacy codebases** already built on Options API.  

But once your project grows past a certain size, **the Composition API becomes the sustainable choice**.

---

## Real-World Example

At TUI Group, we migrated micro frontends from Vue 2 (Options API) to Vue 3 (Composition API).  

- **Before**: components were large, with state spread across `data`, `methods`, and watchers.  
- **After**: we extracted domain logic into composables, improving **readability, reusability, and testability**.  

Result: load times reduced by **75%**, and onboarding new developers became faster since logic was modular and discoverable.

---

## Conclusion

The **Composition API** isn’t just a new syntax — it’s a new way of thinking about Vue architecture.  

By grouping logic, enabling true code reuse, improving TypeScript integration, and simplifying testing, it gives large teams the tools they need to **scale Vue applications sustainably**.  

If you’re working on **enterprise apps**, adopting the Composition API is one of the best decisions you can make for long-term maintainability.

✅ Next steps for you:  
- Try refactoring one of your Vue components from Options API to Composition API.  
- Extract common logic into composables.  
- Measure maintainability and performance improvements.
